    <p>By default, <b>NgModules</b> are eagerly loaded, which means that as soon as the app loads, so do all the NgModules,
        whether or not they are immediately necessary. For large apps with lots of routes, consider <b>lazy loadingâ€”</b>a
        design pattern that loads <b>NgModules</b> as needed. <b>Lazy loading</b> helps keep initial bundle sizes smaller, which in
        turn helps decrease load times.</p>
